## Developing

+TODO+ : 

This was one of my first AngularJS dev. Forgive all mistake, and misbihaviour. They will be fixed soon. If somebody told you that this could be a nice try to begin resum√© please feel free to :
* Use properly scopes
* Avoid jQuery
* All function manipulating scope data without interfering with element within the directive should be in controller
* Use closures and/or service for utilites function
